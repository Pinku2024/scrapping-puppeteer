Over the years, gold investments have increased in popularity as a secure investment option.Investing In Gold and Other Options For Retail Investors in 2024Gold has been the world's currency of the choice from ancient time civilizations to the modern era.

What is a Gold Loan?A gold loan is a type of secured loan that is granted against the collateral of gold ornaments or jewelry. In this type of loan, the borrower pledges their gold items as collateral and the lender provides funds based on the value of the gold pledged. The loan amount sanctioned is usually a percentage of the gold's current market value, typically ranging from 60% to 90% of the value.2. Who is eligible to get a Gold Loan?You can be eligible for a Gold Loan if you are an individual of the age group of 18 to 65 years, and your occupation is salaried professional, self-employed individual, business owner, entrepreneur, student or senior citizen.3. What documents are required to apply for a Gold Loan?* Identity Proof - Aadhaar Card, PAN Card,Voter ID,Passport, or Driving-License   * Address Proof - Aadhaar Card, Voter ID, Passport, Driving-License,Utility-Bill (Phone/Gas/Electricity/Water/Broadband, etc.) / Lease Agreement of a local address that matches the address on your utility bill (in case your permanent address is different from your current residential address) * Form 60 or PAN Card or passport size photograph4. When should you apply for a Gold Loan?* You can consider applying for a gold loan when you have an immediate need for funds and have gold ornaments or jewelry that you can pledge as collateral. Here are some situations when a gold loan may be a suitable option: * Emergencies: In case of a medical emergency or an unexpected financial requirement, a gold loan can provide quick access to funds, as the processing time for such loans is relatively short.* hort-term needs: If you have a short-term requirement for funds, such as to pay for your child's education or to meet your business expenses, a gold loan can be a good option. * Lower credit score: If you have a low credit score and are finding it difficult to get a loan from a bank or financial institution, a gold loan can be a good option as it is a secured loan that does not require a high credit score. * Lower interest rates: Gold loans generally have lower interest rates compared to other unsecured loans, making them an attractive option for borrowers. * No income proof required: Unlike other loans, a gold loan does not require income proof or credit history, which makes it easier for individuals who are self-employed or do not have a regular source of income to apply for a loan.5. What happens if a Gold Loan is not paid?If a gold loan is not paid, the lender has the right to take possession of the gold ornaments or jewelry that were pledged as collateral. The process of taking possession of the gold is as follows: * Issuance of notice: The lender first issues a notice to the borrower, reminding them of the outstanding dues and asking them to repay the loan amount along with any interest or penalty charges that may have accured. * Auction of gold: If the borrower fails to repay the loan amount within the specified period, the lender may auction the gold ornaments or jewelry that were pledged as collateral. The auction process is conducted in a transparent manner, and the proceeds from the sale are used to recover the outstanding loan amount. * Adjustment of proceeds: If the proceeds from the auction are greater than the outstanding loan amount, the lender returns the balance amount to the borrower. However, if the proceeds are lesser than the outstanding loan amount, the borrower is still liable to pay the remaining amount. * Legal action: In case of continued non-payment, the lender may initiate legal action against the borrower to recover the outstanding loan amount. * It is important for borrowers to ensure that they can repay the loan amount within the specified tenure to avoid losing their gold. Borrowers should also read the loan agreement carefully and understand the terms and conditions before availing a gold loan.PRODUCTSGold Loan Offering• Term Loan, OD and Bullet repayment availableGold Loan Interest• HDFC Bank Gold Loan comes with competitive interest rates on Term Loan, Overdraft and EMI based loan.

A credit score defines your creditworthiness, quantifying your repayment ability on the money you raise. Your credit score (CIBIL score/ Experian score) helps banks understand your credit history and determine if you qualify for their loan or not.What is a credit score?A credit score is a number given to you based on your credit history, this number is decided on the basis of your ongoing or recently closed credit activity. Your credit activity can include repayments, applications for loans, existing loans, etc. A credit score is very similar to a school percentage or a college GPA. If you perform well in your assignments in college, you get good credit points which improves your GPA, very similarly if you repay your loans on time you get points that improve your credit score.A good GPA, lets you get good job opportunities, similarly, a good credit score gets you good opportunities to get credit from banks or NBFCs.If you have a bad credit score, there are a number of things you can do to improve it, such as paying your bills on time, keeping your credit utilization ratio low, and building a long credit history.What is a credit report?A credit report is very similar to a report card you must have gotten in your school days. A credit report is a report card of your recent credit history, it contains information on your latest loan repayments, the date of opening of your loan accounts, new applications for loan accounts, and bankruptcies or foreclosures.Why do Banks/NBFCs need a credit score/credit report?Imagine being an official in a bank who decides whether to give or not give a loan to a customer. 100s of customers come to you every day describing their need for a loan. It is important for you to make the right choice since you are giving out money that was entrusted to you by other customers of your bank.You cannot make this call subjectively, neither is it efficient nor is viable to consider each and every customer and their very specific needs. To solve this problem, credit bureaus like TransUnion and Experian came up with the credit score which makes the whole process objective.Credit Bureaus maintain the complete history of a customer’s credit activities, and use them to assign a score to the customer. Banks and NBFCs in turn, use this score to create credit policies that are used as an eligibility criterion for loans.How is credit score calculated?A credit score usually ranges from 300 to 900. If a customer has no credit history, their credit score is indicated as -1 also known as new to credit. Customers who have a credit score above 750 are usually considered as creditworthy however this number can vary from product to product.Credit scores are calculated by bureaus, each bureau has proprietary calculation formulas through which the credit score is calculated but all of them use the following factors to determine your credit score:Payment history:  This is the most important factor in your credit score. It shows how well you have paid your bills in the past.Credit utilization ratio:  This is the amount of credit you are using compared to the amount of credit you have available. A lower credit utilization ratio is better for your credit score.Length of credit history:  The longer your credit history, the better it is for your credit score.Credit mix:  Having a variety of different types of credit accounts, such as credit cards, installment loans, and mortgages, can help to improve your credit score.New inquiries:  Every time you apply for a new loan or credit card, a hard inquiry is placed on your credit report. Too many hard inquiries can lower your credit score.How do Banks and NBFCs read my credit score?CIBIL ScoreIt's Meaning300-549This is the low CIBIL score, Banks and NBFCs will consider you as a highly risky customer550 – 649This is a fair CIBIL score, Banks and NBFCs will know that you are facing some difficulty in repaying your existing commitments650 – 749This is a good CIBIL score, Banks and NBFCs will most probably give you a loan but your interest rate might be higher than others750 – 900CIBIL score above 750 is considered excellent and shows that you have consistently paid your dues on time and have an impressive payment history.

A good credit score and history help one tell banks and NBFCs that they are creditworthy and can pay back the loan amount without defaulting or missing installment payments.Banks and NBFCs in turn reward customers with good credit scores with better deals and exclusive products like credit cards and zero-balance accounts.How can one improve their CIBIL score?Pay your bills on time and in full.

A credit score defines your creditworthiness, quantifying your repayment ability on the money you raise. Your credit score (CIBIL score/ Experian score) helps banks understand your credit history and determine if you qualify for their loan or not.What is a credit score?A credit score is a number given to you based on your credit history, this number is decided on the basis of your ongoing or recently closed credit activity. Your credit activity can include repayments, applications for loans, existing loans, etc. A credit score is very similar to a school percentage or a college GPA. If you perform well in your assignments in college, you get good credit points which improves your GPA, very similarly if you repay your loans on time you get points that improve your credit score.A good GPA, lets you get good job opportunities, similarly, a good credit score gets you good opportunities to get credit from banks or NBFCs.If you have a bad credit score, there are a number of things you can do to improve it, such as paying your bills on time, keeping your credit utilization ratio low, and building a long credit history.What is a credit report?A credit report is very similar to a report card you must have gotten in your school days. A credit report is a report card of your recent credit history, it contains information on your latest loan repayments, the date of opening of your loan accounts, new applications for loan accounts, and bankruptcies or foreclosures.Why do Banks/NBFCs need a credit score/credit report?Imagine being an official in a bank who decides whether to give or not give a loan to a customer. 100s of customers come to you every day describing their need for a loan. It is important for you to make the right choice since you are giving out money that was entrusted to you by other customers of your bank.You cannot make this call subjectively, neither is it efficient nor is viable to consider each and every customer and their very specific needs. To solve this problem, credit bureaus like TransUnion and Experian came up with the credit score which makes the whole process objective.Credit Bureaus maintain the complete history of a customer’s credit activities, and use them to assign a score to the customer. Banks and NBFCs in turn, use this score to create credit policies that are used as an eligibility criterion for loans.How is credit score calculated?A credit score usually ranges from 300 to 900. If a customer has no credit history, their credit score is indicated as -1 also known as new to credit. Customers who have a credit score above 750 are usually considered as creditworthy however this number can vary from product to product.Credit scores are calculated by bureaus, each bureau has proprietary calculation formulas through which the credit score is calculated but all of them use the following factors to determine your credit score:Payment history:  This is the most important factor in your credit score. It shows how well you have paid your bills in the past.Credit utilization ratio:  This is the amount of credit you are using compared to the amount of credit you have available. A lower credit utilization ratio is better for your credit score.Length of credit history:  The longer your credit history, the better it is for your credit score.Credit mix:  Having a variety of different types of credit accounts, such as credit cards, installment loans, and mortgages, can help to improve your credit score.New inquiries:  Every time you apply for a new loan or credit card, a hard inquiry is placed on your credit report. Too many hard inquiries can lower your credit score.How do Banks and NBFCs read my credit score?CIBIL ScoreIt's Meaning300-549This is the low CIBIL score, Banks and NBFCs will consider you as a highly risky customer550 – 649This is a fair CIBIL score, Banks and NBFCs will know that you are facing some difficulty in repaying your existing commitments650 – 749This is a good CIBIL score, Banks and NBFCs will most probably give you a loan but your interest rate might be higher than others750 – 900CIBIL score above 750 is considered excellent and shows that you have consistently paid your dues on time and have an impressive payment history. Banks and NBFCs will consider you a safe customer and will give you low interest rates on your loanIs a good credit/CIBIL score important?It is very important to maintain a good credit score. A good credit score and history help one tell banks and NBFCs that they are creditworthy and can pay back the loan amount without defaulting or missing installment payments.Banks and NBFCs in turn reward customers with good credit scores with better deals and exclusive products like credit cards and zero-balance accounts.How can one improve their CIBIL score?Pay your bills on time and in full. This is the most important factor in your CIBIL score. A good payment history shows that you are a reliable borrower and that you are likely to repay your debts on time.Keep your credit utilization ratio low. This is the amount of credit you are using compared to the amount of credit you have available. A lower credit utilization ratio is better for your CIBIL score.Build a long credit history. The longer your credit history, the better it is for your CIBIL score.Have a variety of different types of credit accounts. Having a variety of different types of credit accounts, such as credit cards, installment loans, and mortgages, can help to improve your CIBIL score.Dispute any inaccurate information on your credit report. You can check your credit report for free once a year from each of the three major credit bureaus: Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. If you find any inaccurate information on your credit report, you can dispute it with the credit bureaus.Avoid opening too many new credit accounts in a short period of time. Each time you apply for a new credit account, a hard inquiry is placed on your credit report. Too many hard inquiries can lower your CIBIL score.Pay down your debt. The less debt you have, the better it is for your CIBIL score.Become an authorized user on a credit card with a good payment history. This can help you to build a credit history if you don't have one already.Be patient. It takes time to improve your CIBIL score. Don't expect to see results overnight.CIBIL Score Vs Experian ScoreCIBIL score and Experian score are two of the most popular credit scores in India.

If the import duty is increased, the price of gold will also increase, making it more expensive for buyers. On the other hand, if the import duty is reduced, the price of gold will decrease, making it more affordable for buyers."},{"HEADER":"Interest Rates: The Inverse Proportion between Gold and Interest","TEXT":"Interest rates also play a crucial role in determining the price of gold in {{city}}. Gold rates and interest rates are inversely proportional, meaning that the demand for gold increases when the rate of interest falls and decreases when interest rates rise. This is because low interest rates make it less attractive for investors to hold onto their savings, leading them to look for alternative investments such as gold. On the other hand, high interest rates make it more attractive for investors to hold onto their savings, reducing the demand for gold and leading to a drop in its price."},{"HEADER":"Inflation: Gold as a Safe Haven in Times of Economic Uncertainty","TEXT":"Inflation is another factor that affects the price of gold in {{city}}. When inflation rates increase, the value of currency falls, leading to a decrease in purchasing power. In such situations, people tend to turn to gold as a safe haven, as it is less likely to lose its value during times of inflation. This increased demand for gold leads to an increase in its price."},{"HEADER":"Demand and Supply: The Fundamental Laws of Economics and Gold Prices","TEXT":"Finally, the price of gold is also affected by the demand and supply of the yellow metal. If the demand for gold rises, the price will also increase, and if the demand falls, the price will decrease. This is because the price of any commodity is determined by the forces of supply and demand, and gold is no exception.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eIn conclusion, gold prices in {{city}} are constantly fluctuating due to several factors such as currency changes, import duty, interest rates, inflation, and demand and supply. Understanding these factors is crucial for buyers and sellers of gold, as it can help them make informed decisions about when to buy or sell gold. Whether you are looking to invest in gold or simply buy gold jewellery, it is important to keep track of the current market conditions and to seek the advice of experts in the field."}]},"FAQS":{"HEADER":"FAQs: Frequently asked questions","QA":[{"HEADER":"Q1.

How to calculate a 22-carat gold rate in {{city}}?","TEXT":"In India, the gold rate is 4000 per gram for 24 karat.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eSo if you are purchasing a 22K gold ring, the price per gram would be 22K/24K*4000 = 3,666.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eHowever, jewellers always charge you more than that because they make their profit on the prevailing gold rate."},{"HEADER":"Q3. What is the reason for the gold price hike in {{city}}?","TEXT":"There are many reasons for the gold price hike in {{city}}. The demand for gold jewellery and investment property have been the main reason, but we see a few other reasons as well.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eThe most important reason for the gold price hike in {{city}} is the increased demand for jewellery. A lot of people are buying gold as jewels, which is making it more expensive to buy. We also see that some people are buying gold as investment property, which is increasing its value over time.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eWe also see that most of the demand comes from jewellery alone—it's not as much about coins or biscuits as it used to be years ago."},{"HEADER":"Q4. How to calculate a 18-carat gold rate in {{city}}?","TEXT":"18 Karat gold has a rich, yellow appearance that is often associated with gold jewellery. This attractive material is commonly used for making engagement rings, watches, and other wearable jewellery. 18 Karat gold is made up of 75% gold and 25% alloy, which is 18 out of 24 parts gold. \u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eThe additional metals in 18K gold provide a good balance between strength and value, while also reducing the risk of skin irritation for people with nickel allergies."},{"HEADER":"Q5. How is today's gold rate in {{city}} determined?","TEXT":"The gold rate in {{city}} today is determined by several factors such as interest rates, demand, local taxes, transportation taxes, state taxes, government policies, and additional costs incurred by jewellers in {{city}}. The gold rate today is directly influenced by the demand for gold jewellery and investment. A higher demand for gold jewellery and investment attracts more people to buy gold, resulting in an increase in gold price.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eInterest rates also play a crucial role in determining the gold rate. When interest rates are low, the demand for gold increases as people tend to invest in gold to earn a higher return on their investment. On the other hand, when interest rates are high, the demand for gold decreases as people have other investment options that offer higher returns.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eIn addition to interest rates and demand, the gold rate in {{city}} is also influenced by taxes such as local taxes, transportation taxes, and state taxes.

Understanding these factors can help you make informed decisions about buying gold in {{city}}."},{"HEADER":"Q6. Should you buy 22 karats or 24 karats in {{city}}?","TEXT":"When it comes to buying gold, one of the biggest decisions people face is whether to opt for 22 karats or 24 karats. Both 22 karats and 24 karats have their own pros and cons, and the final decision depends on the individual's priorities.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e22 karat gold is an alloy that is made up of 91.6% pure gold and the rest is a combination of other metals. This makes 22 karats gold a little stronger and durable compared to 24 karats gold. 22 karats gold is suitable for making jewellery, as it can withstand wear and tear to some extent. Moreover, 22 karats gold is relatively less expensive compared to 24 karats gold.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eOn the other hand, 24 karat gold is the purest form of gold and is 100% gold. It is favoured by investors and people who are looking for the highest quality gold. However, 24 karats gold is softer compared to 22 karats gold and may not be suitable for jewellery that is worn daily. It is more prone to scratches, dents and other forms of damage.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eIn conclusion, both 22 karats and 24 karats gold have their own advantages and disadvantages, and the choice depends on what an individual is looking for. If you are buying gold for jewellery, it may be a good idea to opt for 22 karats gold. But if you are buying gold for investment purposes, it is better to go for 24 karats gold. Ultimately, the choice is yours. Make sure you do your research, understand the market conditions and weigh the pros and cons before making a final decision."},{"HEADER":"Q7. Is the gold price the same all over India?","TEXT":"No, the price of gold is not the same all over India. The price of gold varies from city to city and is influenced by various factors such as taxes, transportation costs, demand, and local policies. The gold price in Mumbai may be different from the price in {{city}} due to differences in taxes and transportation costs. The price of gold is also affected by demand, with cities having higher demand typically having higher prices.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eAdditionally, the price of gold may also be influenced by local policies, such as import duties and taxes. For example, if a particular city has higher import duties, the price of gold in that city may be higher compared to other cities. The Indian government also has policies that affect the price of gold, such as the gold monetization scheme and the goods and services tax (GST).\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eIn conclusion, the price of gold is not the same all over India, and varies from city to city due to a combination of factors such as taxes, transportation costs, demand, and local policies. When buying gold, it is important to consider the local price and to compare prices across different cities to get the best deal."},{"HEADER":"Q8. What is Making Charges on Gold Jewellery in {{city}}?","TEXT":"Making charges on gold jewellery refer to the costs associated with creating a piece of jewellery from raw gold. These charges typically include the cost of design, labour, equipment, and materials used to turn a piece of raw gold into a finished piece of jewellery.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eThe cost of making charges on gold jewellery can vary greatly depending on the design, craftsmanship, and type of jewellery being created. For example, a simple gold band with no intricate design will have a lower making charge than a complex and detailed gold pendant. The labour involved in creating the piece, such as engraving, setting stones, and polishing, also affects the making charges.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eIt is important to note that making charges are separate from the cost of the raw gold itself. When shopping for gold jewellery, it is important to consider both the cost of the gold and the making charges when making a purchase. Some jewellers may have a high markup on making charges, so it is important to shop around and compare prices.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eMaking charges also vary based on the type of gold being used. 22 karat gold has a lower making charge compared to 24 karat gold due to its lower purity and greater durability, while 18 karat gold typically has a higher making charge due to its higher purity and softer nature.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eWhen buying gold jewellery, it is important to consider not only the cost of the gold, but also the making charges. This will help you to determine the total cost of the piece and make an informed purchasing decision. By understanding the making charges, you can also ensure that you are getting value for your money and not paying an inflated price for the labour involved in creating the piece."},{"HEADER":"Q9.

What are the problems faced while investing in Gold in {{city}}?","TEXT":"Gold investment is a long-term strategy, which is not always the best option for short-term gains. When investing in gold, there are several factors to consider, such as taxes, which can significantly impact the returns. \u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eFor example, when purchasing gold coins, you will have to pay taxes on the investment, which can range from 10-15%. This means that in order to make a profit, the price of gold must increase by at least 22% to compensate for the cost of taxes. \u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eThis type of increase may not happen in one year, and therefore, a long-term investment strategy is necessary to make money from gold. The longer you hold the investment, the greater the potential for returns.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eAdditionally, gold prices can be volatile, and there is always the risk of price fluctuations. The value of gold can be influenced by a variety of factors, including geopolitical tensions, economic indicators, and monetary policy. While gold has been a safe-haven asset for centuries, it does not always provide a steady return, and it is important to consider these factors when investing in gold.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eFurthermore, it is crucial to understand that gold is not a traditional investment and does not provide regular income like stocks or bonds. It is considered more of a hedge against inflation and a store of value. For this reason, it is important to have a clear understanding of your investment goals and the role that gold will play in your portfolio before making a decision."}]}}}},"initialLocale":"en","ns":["gold-loan-ads","common","leadsubmisson","gold-rate-today"],"userConfig":{"i18n":{"defaultLocale":"en","locales":["en","hindi","tamil","telugu"],"localeDetection":false},"localePaths":"/vercel/path0/public/locales","reloadOnPrerender":false,"default":{"i18n":{"defaultLocale":"en","locales":["en","hindi","tamil","telugu"],"localeDetection":false},"localePaths":"/vercel/path0/public/locales","reloadOnPrerender":false}}},"seoData":{"page":"gold-loan-ads","keywords":"","jsonld":[{"url":"https://indiagold.co/gold-loan","name":"indiagold","@type":"Organization","sameAs":["https://www.facebook.com/indiagoldbuy/","https://www.instagram.com/indiagoldapp/","https://twitter.com/indiagoldco","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.indiagold.gold.buy.loan","https://www.youtube.com/c/indiagold","https://in.linkedin.com/company/flat-white-capital-pvt-ltd"],"@context":"https://schema.org","contactPoint":[{"@type":"ContactPoint","telephone":"+91-8068495878","areaServed":"IN","contactType":"customer service","contactOption":"TollFree"},{"@type":"ContactPoint","telephone":"1800-123-999-888 ","contactType":"sales"},{"@type":"ContactPoint","telephone":"+91-8068495878","areaServed":["IN"],"contactType":"technical support","contactOption":"TollFree","availableLanguage":["English","Hindi","Tamil","Telugu"]},{"@type":"ContactPoint","telephone":"+91-8068495878","areaServed":["IN"],"contactType":"bill payment","contactOption":"+91-8068495878"}]},{"name":"indiagold gold loans","@type":"LoanOrCredit","amount":[{"name":"debt for agriculture, personal and business use","@type":"MonetaryAmount","value":"8000000","currency":"INR"},{"name":"agriculture gold loan","@type":"MonetaryAmount","value":"8000000","currency":"INR"}],"@context":"https://schema.org","loanTerm":{"@type":"QuantitativeValue","value":"12","unitCode":"MON"},"annualPercentageRate":[{"name":"fixed interest rates","@type":"QuantitativeValue","maxValue":"21","minValue":"10.8"}]},{"name":"Get a gold loan","step":[{"name":"Apply for Loan ","@type":"HowToSection","position":"1","itemListElement":[{"@type":"HowToStep","position":"1","itemListElement":[{"text":"Go to www.indiagold.co or or give a missed call at 1800-123-999-888 and submit your details such as mobile number.","@type":"HowToDirection","position":"1"},{"text":"You will be able to book a free appointment with indiagold Branch Manager directly at your location.","@type":"HowToTip","position":"2"}]},{"@type":"HowToStep","position":"2","itemListElement":[{"text":"Give a time slot to Loan Manager to reach your home.

A higher demand for gold jewellery and investment attracts more people to buy gold, resulting in an increase in gold price.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eInterest rates also play a crucial role in determining the gold rate. When interest rates are low, the demand for gold increases as people tend to invest in gold to earn a higher return on their investment. On the other hand, when interest rates are high, the demand for gold decreases as people have other investment options that offer higher returns.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eIn addition to interest rates and demand, the gold rate in {{city}} is also influenced by taxes such as local taxes, transportation taxes, and state taxes.

Understanding these factors can help you make informed decisions about buying gold in {{city}}."},{"HEADER":"Q6. Should you buy 22 karats or 24 karats in {{city}}?","TEXT":"When it comes to buying gold, one of the biggest decisions people face is whether to opt for 22 karats or 24 karats. Both 22 karats and 24 karats have their own pros and cons, and the final decision depends on the individual's priorities.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e22 karat gold is an alloy that is made up of 91.6% pure gold and the rest is a combination of other metals. This makes 22 karats gold a little stronger and durable compared to 24 karats gold. 22 karats gold is suitable for making jewellery, as it can withstand wear and tear to some extent. Moreover, 22 karats gold is relatively less expensive compared to 24 karats gold.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eOn the other hand, 24 karat gold is the purest form of gold and is 100% gold. It is favoured by investors and people who are looking for the highest quality gold. However, 24 karats gold is softer compared to 22 karats gold and may not be suitable for jewellery that is worn daily. It is more prone to scratches, dents and other forms of damage.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eIn conclusion, both 22 karats and 24 karats gold have their own advantages and disadvantages, and the choice depends on what an individual is looking for. If you are buying gold for jewellery, it may be a good idea to opt for 22 karats gold. But if you are buying gold for investment purposes, it is better to go for 24 karats gold. Ultimately, the choice is yours. Make sure you do your research, understand the market conditions and weigh the pros and cons before making a final decision."},{"HEADER":"Q7. Is the gold price the same all over India?","TEXT":"No, the price of gold is not the same all over India. The price of gold varies from city to city and is influenced by various factors such as taxes, transportation costs, demand, and local policies. The gold price in Mumbai may be different from the price in {{city}} due to differences in taxes and transportation costs. The price of gold is also affected by demand, with cities having higher demand typically having higher prices.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eAdditionally, the price of gold may also be influenced by local policies, such as import duties and taxes. For example, if a particular city has higher import duties, the price of gold in that city may be higher compared to other cities. The Indian government also has policies that affect the price of gold, such as the gold monetization scheme and the goods and services tax (GST).\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eIn conclusion, the price of gold is not the same all over India, and varies from city to city due to a combination of factors such as taxes, transportation costs, demand, and local policies. When buying gold, it is important to consider the local price and to compare prices across different cities to get the best deal."},{"HEADER":"Q8. What is Making Charges on Gold Jewellery in {{city}}?","TEXT":"Making charges on gold jewellery refer to the costs associated with creating a piece of jewellery from raw gold. These charges typically include the cost of design, labour, equipment, and materials used to turn a piece of raw gold into a finished piece of jewellery.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eThe cost of making charges on gold jewellery can vary greatly depending on the design, craftsmanship, and type of jewellery being created. For example, a simple gold band with no intricate design will have a lower making charge than a complex and detailed gold pendant. The labour involved in creating the piece, such as engraving, setting stones, and polishing, also affects the making charges.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eIt is important to note that making charges are separate from the cost of the raw gold itself. When shopping for gold jewellery, it is important to consider both the cost of the gold and the making charges when making a purchase. Some jewellers may have a high markup on making charges, so it is important to shop around and compare prices.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eMaking charges also vary based on the type of gold being used. 22 karat gold has a lower making charge compared to 24 karat gold due to its lower purity and greater durability, while 18 karat gold typically has a higher making charge due to its higher purity and softer nature.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eWhen buying gold jewellery, it is important to consider not only the cost of the gold, but also the making charges. This will help you to determine the total cost of the piece and make an informed purchasing decision. By understanding the making charges, you can also ensure that you are getting value for your money and not paying an inflated price for the labour involved in creating the piece."},{"HEADER":"Q9.

What are the problems faced while investing in Gold in {{city}}?","TEXT":"Gold investment is a long-term strategy, which is not always the best option for short-term gains. When investing in gold, there are several factors to consider, such as taxes, which can significantly impact the returns. \u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eFor example, when purchasing gold coins, you will have to pay taxes on the investment, which can range from 10-15%. This means that in order to make a profit, the price of gold must increase by at least 22% to compensate for the cost of taxes. \u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eThis type of increase may not happen in one year, and therefore, a long-term investment strategy is necessary to make money from gold. The longer you hold the investment, the greater the potential for returns.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eAdditionally, gold prices can be volatile, and there is always the risk of price fluctuations. The value of gold can be influenced by a variety of factors, including geopolitical tensions, economic indicators, and monetary policy. While gold has been a safe-haven asset for centuries, it does not always provide a steady return, and it is important to consider these factors when investing in gold.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eFurthermore, it is crucial to understand that gold is not a traditional investment and does not provide regular income like stocks or bonds. It is considered more of a hedge against inflation and a store of value. For this reason, it is important to have a clear understanding of your investment goals and the role that gold will play in your portfolio before making a decision."}]}},"leadsubmisson":{"submit_your_details":"Submit your details","full_name":"Full Name","mobile_number":"Mobile Number","pin_code":"Pin Code","apply_now":"Apply Now","contact_you":"By submitting the above information, you allow indiagold’s representatives to contact you","enter_otp":"Enter OTP","otp_sent_mobile":"Please enter the OTP sent to {{mobileNumber}} to submit your response","otp":"OTP","verify_otp":"VERIFY OTP","resend_otp":"RESEND OTP","thanks":"Thank you for submitting your details!

The interest rate is usually calculated on an annual basis, but is often expressed as a monthly rate for ease of understanding.The interest rate for a gold loan is based on several factors, including:Loan amount:  The interest rate may be higher for larger loan amounts, as the lender may perceive larger loans to be more risky.Loan tenure: Longer loan tenures may be associated with higher interest rates, as the lender is exposed to more risk over a longer period of time.Gold purity: The purity of the gold used as collateral can also affect the interest rate. Lenders may offer lower interest rates for higher-purity gold, as it is considered to be more valuable and easier to sell.Market conditions: A gold loan calculator provides transparency in the loan calculation process, and helps you understand the various factors that influence the loan amount. This can help you make more informed decisions about your finances, and avoid any surprises or hidden costs later on.Once the interest rate is determined, the interest is calculated by multiplying the loan amount by the interest rate and dividing it by the number of months in the loan tenure. For example, if the interest rate is 10% per annum and the loan tenure is 12 months, the monthly interest rate would be 0.83% (10%/12). If the loan amount is Rs. 1,00,000, the monthly interest would be Rs. 830 (1,00,000 x 0.83%/month).What is gold loan calculator?Gold loan calculator is an online tool that helps you figure out how much you can borrow against your gold, how much interest you'll owe, and what your monthly payments might be.

Unlike traditional loans where EMIs cover both principal and interest, gold loans often follow a different structure. With gold loans, you typically pay only the interest during the loan tenure, and the principal amount borrowed is due at the end. This means your EMIs mainly cover the interest accrued on the outstanding loan amount, with the principal repayment due in full at the loan's maturity. If you are still confused about how this works out, our Gold Loan Calculator can help estimate your interest payments and overall repayment.

However, the price of gold is constantly fluctuating, making it difficult for buyers and sellers to keep track of its value. In this blog, we will explore the reasons behind the fluctuation of gold prices in {{city}}, India."},"WHY_GOLD_RATE_FLUCTUATE_QA":{"QA":[{"HEADER":"Currency Changes: The Impact of the Rupee-Dollar Exchange Rate","TEXT":"One of the main factors that affects the price of gold is the value of the rupee against the dollar. As the value of the rupee changes, the import price of gold also changes, leading to fluctuations in the price at which gold is sold in {{city}}. For example, if the value of the rupee falls against the dollar, the import price of gold will increase, leading to a rise in the price of gold. On the other hand, if the value of the rupee increases against the dollar, the import price of gold will decrease, leading to a drop in the price of gold."},{"HEADER":"Import Duty: How Government Policies Affect Gold Prices","TEXT":"Another factor that affects the price of gold is the import duty imposed by the Indian government. As the demand for gold in India is high, any changes in the import duty will have a significant impact on the prices of gold in {{city}}. If the import duty is increased, the price of gold will also increase, making it more expensive for buyers. On the other hand, if the import duty is reduced, the price of gold will decrease, making it more affordable for buyers."},{"HEADER":"Interest Rates: The Inverse Proportion between Gold and Interest","TEXT":"Interest rates also play a crucial role in determining the price of gold in {{city}}. Gold rates and interest rates are inversely proportional, meaning that the demand for gold increases when the rate of interest falls and decreases when interest rates rise. This is because low interest rates make it less attractive for investors to hold onto their savings, leading them to look for alternative investments such as gold. On the other hand, high interest rates make it more attractive for investors to hold onto their savings, reducing the demand for gold and leading to a drop in its price."},{"HEADER":"Inflation: Gold as a Safe Haven in Times of Economic Uncertainty","TEXT":"Inflation is another factor that affects the price of gold in {{city}}. When inflation rates increase, the value of currency falls, leading to a decrease in purchasing power. In such situations, people tend to turn to gold as a safe haven, as it is less likely to lose its value during times of inflation. This increased demand for gold leads to an increase in its price."},{"HEADER":"Demand and Supply: The Fundamental Laws of Economics and Gold Prices","TEXT":"Finally, the price of gold is also affected by the demand and supply of the yellow metal. If the demand for gold rises, the price will also increase, and if the demand falls, the price will decrease. This is because the price of any commodity is determined by the forces of supply and demand, and gold is no exception.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eIn conclusion, gold prices in {{city}} are constantly fluctuating due to several factors such as currency changes, import duty, interest rates, inflation, and demand and supply. Understanding these factors is crucial for buyers and sellers of gold, as it can help them make informed decisions about when to buy or sell gold.

Should you buy 22 karats or 24 karats in {{city}}?","TEXT":"When it comes to buying gold, one of the biggest decisions people face is whether to opt for 22 karats or 24 karats.

Moreover, 22 karats gold is relatively less expensive compared to 24 karats gold.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eOn the other hand, 24 karat gold is the purest form of gold and is 100% gold. It is favoured by investors and people who are looking for the highest quality gold.

What are the problems faced while investing in Gold in {{city}}?","TEXT":"Gold investment is a long-term strategy, which is not always the best option for short-term gains. When investing in gold, there are several factors to consider, such as taxes, which can significantly impact the returns. \u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eFor example, when purchasing gold coins, you will have to pay taxes on the investment, which can range from 10-15%.

Here are some of the gold loan repayment schemes available.Bullet repayment:When you take out a gold loan, you are not required to pay interest or the principal amount. Instead, you will pay both interest and principal at the end of your loan term. This is called bullet repayment because you pay the whole amount at once at the end of your loan term.Partial repayments:Partial payments are another way to pay back the gold loan. To suit your needs and preferences, you can make partial principal and interest payments. It is not necessary in this kind of gold repayment technique to adhere to the EMI system. With your lender, you may set up your gold loan repayment schedule online and make full or partial payments on the principal as well as interest. This is specially beneficial to business owners using gold loans for working capital requirements.Pay off interest first:Through this option, you can repay the interest amount as per the EMI schedule of the gold loan however the principal amount borrowed is to be paid, in full, at the time of maturity. Such an arrangement works wonders for most borrowers as throughout the loan tenure one is liable only to pay the interest and not worry about principal repayment.Regular EMI’s:The majority of gold loan applicants like recurring EMIs. The loan balance must be repaid by borrowers starting in the month after the month of disbursement. It is regarded as an appropriate choice for salaried individuals who have a monthly revenue flow. Both the principal and interest amounts are included in the EMI each month. Due to the monthly deductions from your account, the payback process for gold loans is quick and simple.WHAT IS A GOLD LOAN?A gold loan is an alternative to traditional forms of loans.

As the value of the rupee changes, the import price of gold also changes, leading to fluctuations in the price at which gold is sold in {{city}}. For example, if the value of the rupee falls against the dollar, the import price of gold will increase, leading to a rise in the price of gold.

This increased demand for gold leads to an increase in its price."},{"HEADER":"Demand and Supply: The Fundamental Laws of Economics and Gold Prices","TEXT":"Finally, the price of gold is also affected by the demand and supply of the yellow metal.

What are the problems faced while investing in Gold in {{city}}?","TEXT":"Gold investment is a long-term strategy, which is not always the best option for short-term gains.

Here are some of the gold loan repayment schemes available.Bullet repayment:When you take out a gold loan, you are not required to pay interest or the principal amount.

This is called bullet repayment because you pay the whole amount at once at the end of your loan term.Partial repayments:Partial payments are another way to pay back the gold loan.

With your lender, you may set up your gold loan repayment schedule online and make full or partial payments on the principal as well as interest.

Such an arrangement works wonders for most borrowers as throughout the loan tenure one is liable only to pay the interest and not worry about principal repayment.Regular EMI’s:The majority of gold loan applicants like recurring EMIs. The loan balance must be repaid by borrowers starting in the month after the month of disbursement. It is regarded as an appropriate choice for salaried individuals who have a monthly revenue flow. Both the principal and interest amounts are included in the EMI each month. Due to the monthly deductions from your account, the payback process for gold loans is quick and simple.WHAT IS A GOLD LOAN?A gold loan is an alternative to traditional forms of loans.

Should you buy 22 karats or 24 karats in {{city}}?","TEXT":"When it comes to buying gold, one of the biggest decisions people face is whether to opt for 22 karats or 24 karats. Both 22 karats and 24 karats have their own pros and cons, and the final decision depends on the individual's priorities.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e22 karat gold is an alloy that is made up of 91.6% pure gold and the rest is a combination of other metals. This makes 22 karats gold a little stronger and durable compared to 24 karats gold. 22 karats gold is suitable for making jewellery, as it can withstand wear and tear to some extent. Moreover, 22 karats gold is relatively less expensive compared to 24 karats gold.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eOn the other hand, 24 karat gold is the purest form of gold and is 100% gold. It is favoured by investors and people who are looking for the highest quality gold. However, 24 karats gold is softer compared to 22 karats gold and may not be suitable for jewellery that is worn daily. It is more prone to scratches, dents and other forms of damage.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eIn conclusion, both 22 karats and 24 karats gold have their own advantages and disadvantages, and the choice depends on what an individual is looking for.

What are the problems faced while investing in Gold in {{city}}?","TEXT":"Gold investment is a long-term strategy, which is not always the best option for short-term gains. When investing in gold, there are several factors to consider, such as taxes, which can significantly impact the returns. \u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eFor example, when purchasing gold coins, you will have to pay taxes on the investment, which can range from 10-15%.

The value of gold can be influenced by a variety of factors, including geopolitical tensions, economic indicators, and monetary policy.

In this blog, we will explore the reasons behind the fluctuation of gold prices in {{city}}, India."},"WHY_GOLD_RATE_FLUCTUATE_QA":{"QA":[{"HEADER":"Currency Changes: The Impact of the Rupee-Dollar Exchange Rate","TEXT":"One of the main factors that affects the price of gold is the value of the rupee against the dollar. As the value of the rupee changes, the import price of gold also changes, leading to fluctuations in the price at which gold is sold in {{city}}. For example, if the value of the rupee falls against the dollar, the import price of gold will increase, leading to a rise in the price of gold.

With so many designs, styles, and variations to choose from, it's important to consider several factors before making a purchase. We'll discuss the key things to keep in mind when buying gold jewellery in Delhi.Know the purity of gold:The purity of gold is measured in karats, with 24 karat gold being the purest form. The higher the karat, the more gold content the jewellery contains and the more valuable it is. However, higher karat gold is also more delicate and susceptible to scratches and damage.Check for a hallmark:Hallmarking is a certification process that ensures the quality and purity of gold jewellery. A hallmark certificate is a guarantee that the jewellery you're buying is made of the gold content it claims to be. Make sure the jewellery you buy has a hallmark certificate from the Bureau of Indian Standards.Consider design and style:When buying gold jewellery, it's important to consider the design and style that best suits your taste. From classic and elegant designs to modern and contemporary styles, there's a wide range of options to choose from. Take the time to find a piece that you love and that complements your personal style.Get the right size:Gold jewellery comes in a range of sizes and shapes, so it's important to make sure you get the right size for you. Consider having your fingers measured before you make a purchase to ensure a perfect fit.Look for quality craftsmanship:Good quality gold jewellery should have clean lines and a smooth finish. Look for pieces that are well-made and have no obvious flaws or defects.Consider the price:Gold jewellery can range from inexpensive to very expensive. Before making a purchase, consider your budget and the quality of the piece you're interested in. Keep in mind that the price of gold can fluctuate, so it's best to buy when the prices are low.Shop around:Take the time to shop around and compare prices and quality from different jewellery stores. This will help you find the best deal and ensure you're getting the best value for your money.Know the return policy:Make sure you understand the return policy of the jewellery store before making a purchase. If you're not happy with your purchase, it's important to know if you can return the piece for a refund or exchange it for something else.Get a warranty:Good quality gold jewellery should come with a warranty. This can provide peace of mind and protect your investment in case of damage or defects.Seek advice:If you're not familiar with buying gold jewellery, consider seeking advice from a trusted friend, family member, or jewellery expert. They can help you make an informed decision and avoid making a costly mistake.In conclusion, buying gold jewellery in Delhi is a meaningful and exciting experience, but it's important to keep several key factors in mind. From the purity of the gold to the design and style of the piece, it's essential to consider all aspects of the jewellery before making a purchase. With these tips in mind, you'll be able to find the perfect piece of gold jewellery that will be treasured for years to come.Some Interesting Facts about Gold (The Yellow metal)The word "gold" comes from the Old English word "geolu," meaning yellow.Gold is often used as a store of value and as a hedge against currency fluctuations and inflation.The largest gold nugget ever found weighed 2,520 pounds (1,142 kg).India is the world's largest consumer of gold, and has a long history of gold mining.Gold has been used in India for thousands of years for jewellery, coinage, and religious offerings.In Hinduism, gold is considered a symbol of wealth and purity, and is often associated with the sun god Surya.Gold jewellery is an important part of many traditional Indian weddings.The Indian gold market is largely unregulated and informal, with most gold being imported and sold through jewellery shops and pawn brokers.India's love for gold has led to large trade deficits and a dependence on imported gold, which has contributed to the country's economic problems.Despite this, gold remains an important part of the Indian economy and culture, and the government has taken steps to encourage the development of a domestic gold industry.The Reserve Bank of India is one of the largest holders of gold reserves in the world, with approximately 566 tonnes as of 2021.The Ministry of Mines estimates that India has gold reserves of approximately 300 tonnes in the form of gold ore deposits.According to industry experts, only 30% of gold sold in India is hallmarked, indicating that the majority of gold in circulation is not of guaranteed quality.China is the leading producer of gold, with an output of over 3.61 tons annually.South Africa is a close second, producing more than 2/3rds of the world's gold supply.Gold is highly malleable and ductile, allowing it to be shaped into thin sheets, with an ounce of gold capable of producing a sheet of 100 square feet.Gold is an excellent conductor of electricity, making it a useful material in electronics and electrical applications.India is the largest consumer of gold, with a long-standing cultural tradition of gold jewellery and usage in religious ceremonies.However, as times are changing, Indian consumers are becoming more interested in diamonds, with a shift away from traditional gold jewellery.Why does the Gold rate fluctuate daily in Delhi?Gold is one of the most precious metals in the world and has been used as a symbol of wealth and prosperity for centuries. However, the price of gold is constantly fluctuating, making it difficult for buyers and sellers to keep track of its value. In this blog, we will explore the reasons behind the fluctuation of gold prices in Delhi, India.Currency Changes: The Impact of the Rupee-Dollar Exchange RateOne of the main factors that affects the price of gold is the value of the rupee against the dollar. As the value of the rupee changes, the import price of gold also changes, leading to fluctuations in the price at which gold is sold in Delhi. For example, if the value of the rupee falls against the dollar, the import price of gold will increase, leading to a rise in the price of gold. On the other hand, if the value of the rupee increases against the dollar, the import price of gold will decrease, leading to a drop in the price of gold.Import Duty: How Government Policies Affect Gold PricesAnother factor that affects the price of gold is the import duty imposed by the Indian government. As the demand for gold in India is high, any changes in the import duty will have a significant impact on the prices of gold in Delhi. If the import duty is increased, the price of gold will also increase, making it more expensive for buyers. On the other hand, if the import duty is reduced, the price of gold will decrease, making it more affordable for buyers.Interest Rates: The Inverse Proportion between Gold and InterestInterest rates also play a crucial role in determining the price of gold in Delhi. Gold rates and interest rates are inversely proportional, meaning that the demand for gold increases when the rate of interest falls and decreases when interest rates rise. This is because low interest rates make it less attractive for investors to hold onto their savings, leading them to look for alternative investments such as gold. On the other hand, high interest rates make it more attractive for investors to hold onto their savings, reducing the demand for gold and leading to a drop in its price.Inflation: Gold as a Safe Haven in Times of Economic UncertaintyInflation is another factor that affects the price of gold in Delhi. When inflation rates increase, the value of currency falls, leading to a decrease in purchasing power. In such situations, people tend to turn to gold as a safe haven, as it is less likely to lose its value during times of inflation. This increased demand for gold leads to an increase in its price.Demand and Supply: The Fundamental Laws of Economics and Gold PricesFinally, the price of gold is also affected by the demand and supply of the yellow metal. If the demand for gold rises, the price will also increase, and if the demand falls, the price will decrease. This is because the price of any commodity is determined by the forces of supply and demand, and gold is no exception.In conclusion, gold prices in Delhi are constantly fluctuating due to several factors such as currency changes, import duty, interest rates, inflation, and demand and supply. Understanding these factors is crucial for buyers and sellers of gold, as it can help them make informed decisions about when to buy or sell gold. Whether you are looking to invest in gold or simply buy gold jewellery, it is important to keep track of the current market conditions and to seek the advice of experts in the field.FAQs: Frequently asked questionsQ1. What is the gold price today in Delhi?The current gold rate in Delhi for 22 carat, also known as 916 KDM hallmark gold, is 6857Q2. How to calculate a 22-carat gold rate in Delhi?In India, the gold rate is 4000 per gram for 24 karat.So if you are purchasing a 22K gold ring, the price per gram would be 22K/24K*4000 = 3,666.However, jewellers always charge you more than that because they make their profit on the prevailing gold rate.Q3. What is the reason for the gold price hike in Delhi?There are many reasons for the gold price hike in Delhi. The demand for gold jewellery and investment property have been the main reason, but we see a few other reasons as well.The most important reason for the gold price hike in Delhi is the increased demand for jewellery. A lot of people are buying gold as jewels, which is making it more expensive to buy. We also see that some people are buying gold as investment property, which is increasing its value over time.We also see that most of the demand comes from jewellery alone—it's not as much about coins or biscuits as it used to be years ago.Q4. How to calculate a 18-carat gold rate in Delhi?18 Karat gold has a rich, yellow appearance that is often associated with gold jewellery. This attractive material is commonly used for making engagement rings, watches, and other wearable jewellery. 18 Karat gold is made up of 75% gold and 25% alloy, which is 18 out of 24 parts gold. The additional metals in 18K gold provide a good balance between strength and value, while also reducing the risk of skin irritation for people with nickel allergies.Q5. How is today's gold rate in Delhi determined?The gold rate in Delhi today is determined by several factors such as interest rates, demand, local taxes, transportation taxes, state taxes, government policies, and additional costs incurred by jewellers in Delhi. The gold rate today is directly influenced by the demand for gold jewellery and investment. A higher demand for gold jewellery and investment attracts more people to buy gold, resulting in an increase in gold price.Interest rates also play a crucial role in determining the gold rate. When interest rates are low, the demand for gold increases as people tend to invest in gold to earn a higher return on their investment. On the other hand, when interest rates are high, the demand for gold decreases as people have other investment options that offer higher returns.In addition to interest rates and demand, the gold rate in Delhi is also influenced by taxes such as local taxes, transportation taxes, and state taxes. The government policies and additional costs incurred by jewellers in Delhi also affect the gold rate.It is important to note that the gold rate in Delhi provides a clear trend structure, making it easier to understand the next gold price hike. This information can help investors and buyers make informed decisions about buying gold.In conclusion, the gold rate in Delhi today is determined by a combination of various factors such as interest rates, demand, taxes, government policies, and additional costs incurred by jewellers in Delhi. Understanding these factors can help you make informed decisions about buying gold in Delhi.Q6. Should you buy 22 karats or 24 karats in Delhi?When it comes to buying gold, one of the biggest decisions people face is whether to opt for 22 karats or 24 karats. Both 22 karats and 24 karats have their own pros and cons, and the final decision depends on the individual's priorities.22 karat gold is an alloy that is made up of 91.6% pure gold and the rest is a combination of other metals. This makes 22 karats gold a little stronger and durable compared to 24 karats gold. 22 karats gold is suitable for making jewellery, as it can withstand wear and tear to some extent. Moreover, 22 karats gold is relatively less expensive compared to 24 karats gold.On the other hand, 24 karat gold is the purest form of gold and is 100% gold. It is favoured by investors and people who are looking for the highest quality gold. However, 24 karats gold is softer compared to 22 karats gold and may not be suitable for jewellery that is worn daily. It is more prone to scratches, dents and other forms of damage.In conclusion, both 22 karats and 24 karats gold have their own advantages and disadvantages, and the choice depends on what an individual is looking for. If you are buying gold for jewellery, it may be a good idea to opt for 22 karats gold. But if you are buying gold for investment purposes, it is better to go for 24 karats gold. Ultimately, the choice is yours. Make sure you do your research, understand the market conditions and weigh the pros and cons before making a final decision.apply now for gold loan withGet funds in 45 minutes!Apply Nowindiagold is in partnership with HDFC Bankapply now for gold loan withGet funds in 45 minutes!+91Apply Nowindiagold is in partnership with AXIS BankQ7. Is the gold price the same all over India?No, the price of gold is not the same all over India. The price of gold varies from city to city and is influenced by various factors such as taxes, transportation costs, demand, and local policies. The gold price in Mumbai may be different from the price in Delhi due to differences in taxes and transportation costs. The price of gold is also affected by demand, with cities having higher demand typically having higher prices.Additionally, the price of gold may also be influenced by local policies, such as import duties and taxes. For example, if a particular city has higher import duties, the price of gold in that city may be higher compared to other cities. The Indian government also has policies that affect the price of gold, such as the gold monetization scheme and the goods and services tax (GST).In conclusion, the price of gold is not the same all over India, and varies from city to city due to a combination of factors such as taxes, transportation costs, demand, and local policies. When buying gold, it is important to consider the local price and to compare prices across different cities to get the best deal.Q8. What is Making Charges on Gold Jewellery in Delhi?Making charges on gold jewellery refer to the costs associated with creating a piece of jewellery from raw gold. These charges typically include the cost of design, labour, equipment, and materials used to turn a piece of raw gold into a finished piece of jewellery.The cost of making charges on gold jewellery can vary greatly depending on the design, craftsmanship, and type of jewellery being created. For example, a simple gold band with no intricate design will have a lower making charge than a complex and detailed gold pendant. The labour involved in creating the piece, such as engraving, setting stones, and polishing, also affects the making charges.It is important to note that making charges are separate from the cost of the raw gold itself. When shopping for gold jewellery, it is important to consider both the cost of the gold and the making charges when making a purchase. Some jewellers may have a high markup on making charges, so it is important to shop around and compare prices.Making charges also vary based on the type of gold being used. 22 karat gold has a lower making charge compared to 24 karat gold due to its lower purity and greater durability, while 18 karat gold typically has a higher making charge due to its higher purity and softer nature.When buying gold jewellery, it is important to consider not only the cost of the gold, but also the making charges. This will help you to determine the total cost of the piece and make an informed purchasing decision. By understanding the making charges, you can also ensure that you are getting value for your money and not paying an inflated price for the labour involved in creating the piece.Q9. Importance of Tracking Live Gold Prices in DelhiOne of the key benefits of tracking live gold prices in Delhi is that it helps people stay updated with the latest market trends. This information is crucial for investors who want to invest in gold as it helps them determine the right time to buy or sell their gold assets. Tracking live gold prices also helps people determine the market value of their gold jewellery, which is essential when selling or exchanging their gold.Another reason why it is important to track live gold prices in Delhi is that it provides a clear picture of the demand-supply dynamics of the gold market. If there is a high demand for gold, the prices are likely to go up, and if there is low demand, the prices are likely to go down. This information can help people make informed decisions about their investments and plan their finances accordingly.In conclusion, tracking live gold prices in Delhi is crucial for people who want to make informed decisions about their investments.

So, if you are planning to invest in gold, make sure you stay updated with the live gold prices in Delhi.Q10. What are the problems faced while investing in Gold in Delhi?Gold investment is a long-term strategy, which is not always the best option for short-term gains. When investing in gold, there are several factors to consider, such as taxes, which can significantly impact the returns. For example, when purchasing gold coins, you will have to pay taxes on the investment, which can range from 10-15%. This means that in order to make a profit, the price of gold must increase by at least 22% to compensate for the cost of taxes. This type of increase may not happen in one year, and therefore, a long-term investment strategy is necessary to make money from gold. The longer you hold the investment, the greater the potential for returns.Additionally, gold prices can be volatile, and there is always the risk of price fluctuations. The value of gold can be influenced by a variety of factors, including geopolitical tensions, economic indicators, and monetary policy. While gold has been a safe-haven asset for centuries, it does not always provide a steady return, and it is important to consider these factors when investing in gold.Furthermore, it is crucial to understand that gold is not a traditional investment and does not provide regular income like stocks or bonds. It is considered more of a hedge against inflation and a store of value. For this reason, it is important to have a clear understanding of your investment goals and the role that gold will play in your portfolio before making a decision.DOWNLOAD OUR APP *24% Annual Rate Of Interest.

What is a Gold Loan?A gold loan is a type of secured loan that is granted against the collateral of gold ornaments or jewelry. In this type of loan, the borrower pledges their gold items as collateral and the lender provides funds based on the value of the gold pledged. The loan amount sanctioned is usually a percentage of the gold's current market value, typically ranging from 60% to 90% of the value.2. Who is eligible to get a Gold Loan?You can be eligible for a Gold Loan if you are an individual of the age group of 18 to 65 years, and your occupation is salaried professional, self-employed individual, business owner, entrepreneur, student or senior citizen.3. What documents are required to apply for a Gold Loan?* Identity Proof - Aadhaar Card, PAN Card,Voter ID,Passport, or Driving-License   * Address Proof - Aadhaar Card, Voter ID, Passport, Driving-License,Utility-Bill (Phone/Gas/Electricity/Water/Broadband, etc.) / Lease Agreement of a local address that matches the address on your utility bill (in case your permanent address is different from your current residential address) * Form 60 or PAN Card or passport size photograph4. When should you apply for a Gold Loan?* You can consider applying for a gold loan when you have an immediate need for funds and have gold ornaments or jewelry that you can pledge as collateral. Here are some situations when a gold loan may be a suitable option: * Emergencies: In case of a medical emergency or an unexpected financial requirement, a gold loan can provide quick access to funds, as the processing time for such loans is relatively short.* hort-term needs: If you have a short-term requirement for funds, such as to pay for your child's education or to meet your business expenses, a gold loan can be a good option. * Lower credit score: If you have a low credit score and are finding it difficult to get a loan from a bank or financial institution, a gold loan can be a good option as it is a secured loan that does not require a high credit score. * Lower interest rates: Gold loans generally have lower interest rates compared to other unsecured loans, making them an attractive option for borrowers. * No income proof required: Unlike other loans, a gold loan does not require income proof or credit history, which makes it easier for individuals who are self-employed or do not have a regular source of income to apply for a loan.5. What happens if a Gold Loan is not paid?If a gold loan is not paid, the lender has the right to take possession of the gold ornaments or jewelry that were pledged as collateral. The process of taking possession of the gold is as follows: * Issuance of notice: The lender first issues a notice to the borrower, reminding them of the outstanding dues and asking them to repay the loan amount along with any interest or penalty charges that may have accured. * Auction of gold: If the borrower fails to repay the loan amount within the specified period, the lender may auction the gold ornaments or jewelry that were pledged as collateral. The auction process is conducted in a transparent manner, and the proceeds from the sale are used to recover the outstanding loan amount. * Adjustment of proceeds: If the proceeds from the auction are greater than the outstanding loan amount, the lender returns the balance amount to the borrower. However, if the proceeds are lesser than the outstanding loan amount, the borrower is still liable to pay the remaining amount. * Legal action: In case of continued non-payment, the lender may initiate legal action against the borrower to recover the outstanding loan amount. * It is important for borrowers to ensure that they can repay the loan amount within the specified tenure to avoid losing their gold. Borrowers should also read the loan agreement carefully and understand the terms and conditions before availing a gold loan.Call us on +91 8045 588 641 for any complaints or support.Call NowTerms & Conditions*24% Annual percentage rate ( APR ).
